# Grayscale Template

This vite app spinup is designed to help style a SPA experience with sighted accessibility in mind. The goal is to keep all styling elements at a contrast of 4 or higher to their adjacent or neighboring elements.

Hopefully this tool will make the dev experience simpler, since it can keep contrast concerns separate from hue choices, making these decisions more granular and less-interdependent. Once the lights and darks are chosen and in place, a palette can easily be applied by swapping the correctly-weighted color with its hue-less counterpart.
